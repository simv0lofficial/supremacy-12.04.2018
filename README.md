probably the most oldest leaked supremacy src i have ever seen

all files dated from 12.04.18 (obv src is much older)

message from dex about this/other leaks, 'dex-interwebz' github account (github.com/dex-interwebz) and other shit:







-The source code on GitHub was not leaked by me, and is just people being weird and using my alias.

-The code posted by OP is not the original source code, it is heavily modified & still VERY similar to the GitHub leak (over 50% of the files are changed in some way, or similar to the original leak... I have not compared these files with the other GitHub leak, but there was also some weird code formatter used on it). There are people with versions of it that are 95% similar to what I have, from what I know. It was probably given out slowly by friends of friends of friends...

-I was never part of the Interwebz team. It was just eventually decided to be sold and not the way I wanted it to be.

-Supremacy was actually made by 3 people, including me, and I did not code the rage bot, only specific parts of it. I mostly worked on parts of visuals, the base/utilities & autowall.

-I don't play HvH and haven't since 2018-2019 or so.

-I do not play legacy/2018 HvH and was only on it briefly sometimes in early 2023.

-I have not helped anyone code a cheat, and I have not coded for CS:GO in many many years. Besides maybe talking to people here and there and giving some hints, I was never part of any other project.

-I wrote Supremacy 7 years ago. While I appreciate if it helps people, I'm not going to provide support & it's old news now. I don't think its impressive or anything, but it was fun to code it.

-I don't know any of you, and I'm probably not your friend, talking about me like you know me is just... weird. I'm just another coder and do it for fun. Please understand.
